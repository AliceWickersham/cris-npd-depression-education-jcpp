# Depression and educational attainment trajectories: Supporting code

This repository contains supporting code for "[Association between depression diagnosis and educational attainment trajectories: an historical cohort study using linked data.](http://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13759)" It contains code in three parts:

 - Part 1: Stata code used prior to growth mixture modelling to clean National Pupil Database ([NPD](https://find-npd-data.education.gov.uk/)) data, and to define the study sample.
 - Part 2: Mplus code used for the final five-trajectory growth mixture model.
 - Part 3: Stata code used after growth mixture modelling to further clean NPD data and Clinical Record Interactive Search ([CRIS](https://www.maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/facilities/clinical-record-interactive-search-cris/)) data, and to conduct multinomial logistic regression analyses.

The code was was developed by  [Alice Wickersham](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/alice-wickersham) during her time as an NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre PhD Student at King's College London.
